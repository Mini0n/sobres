Get, decrypt and display info
<br/>
<br/>
### ⚠️ This is currently just a proof of concept
<br/>

## About
1. Encrypt some info (text-only) you want to share.
2. Save the encrypted info in a public reachable URL (like a GitHub repo).
3. Configure the decipher template to reach that URL and get the cyphered info.
4. Save the template in a public reachable URL (like a GitHub repo).
5. Share the URL. Anyone with the correct password will be able to read the info.

## Ideas
- Template generator
- Password validation inb4
- Multiple outputs depending on user/password (sobre chunk format?)
- Binary support? (doubtful; timeouts and memory)
- Compression? (doubtful -> binary)
